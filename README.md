## What is Mumlatz

Ever wanted to buy something but didn't want to do the market research? So what do you do, you ask a friend what they have, and if they like it or not right?
So that's Mumlatz. It's an app for social product review sharing. You enter what products you own and if you recommend them, your friends do the same, and you are able to search for prodct recommendations by the people you know and trust. 

Mumlatz was created as an educational project. 

## Some technicalities

This repo was create using [Create T3 Turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo). I suggest checking out their README.

It includes:
A React Native App using Expo
A tRPC API
A Prisma Database 

I know these all sounds new and scary, but don't worry! They're new to me too ðŸ™‚

Here are some links about these technologies:

* [What is tRPC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9KPBIIKCHY&ab_channel=Evoqys)

This project uses `pnpm` as a package manager. Here's [how to install it](https://pnpm.io/installation)

* A very (very) basic (beginning of a) [mockup](https://excalidraw.com/#json=ImPgbDdM7A-HpHhKQSRIv,5HbrBJxcsV_wsGIIFMUFtw) for the Mumlatz app:
* Our official [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-bkn2400/shared_invite/zt-1inod2x2e-UZRs7189ueYnwHWwDFwATg)! Please join it

This project is in very early stages, but together we will bring it to life!
